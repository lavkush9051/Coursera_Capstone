Hence it is very important to be able to reduce the risk of severity before accidents occur. And for this project, the aim is to build a model that can predict the severity of accidents in junctions around different types of address block and collision types using attributes such as weather and light conditions."

The initial dataset consists of 38 columns (features/attributes) and 194673 rows. Python packages will be used to conduct this study. The dataset will be cleaned according to the requirements of this project.
